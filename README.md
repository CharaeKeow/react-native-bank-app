# React Native Bank App

## Project Setup Note

This repo is initialized from [Expo TypeScript template](https://docs.expo.dev/more/create-expo/#--template). I opted for this template instead of default one because for the sake's of learning and refreshing my React Native and Expo knowledge, starting from bare minimum is better.

Besides, I also opted to just use [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) when developing this app instead of development build, due to I don't want to deal with the Android/iOS emulator setup, which I assume will take quite some time last time, based on past experience when I was doing React Native development back in 2021-22.
